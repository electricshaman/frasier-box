Frasier Box
======
Elixir application for Raspberry Pi that plays X number of random videos in a queue after receiving start command via UDP.
The queue will exclude any videos which have been played in the previous X number of days.
Playback can be stopped via UDP command.
The videos are played using omxplayer.

This project was built for my wife, who likes to watch Frasier when she goes to sleep at night.  This version is a port of the original I built in 2005 which ran on XBMC.
